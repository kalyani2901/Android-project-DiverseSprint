App to promote tree diversity using a game approach

An android App which uses open data of trees from "city of melbourne" and plots each tree on the map.
User can start his/ her journey, collect points based on the number and type of trees crossed. 
Eventually user unlock tree information by passing across it and can get to know about beautiful tree diversity.
Some interesting features such as diversity rating, uploading picture of the journey and growing a virtual tree is also included to make the game interesting!

--A powerful and easy to use MPAndroid chart library is used to enhance the user interface by plotting pie charts.
